Who Developed C Language?

```Dennis Ritchie``` 

History of C
```
C is a general-purpose programming language created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie.
It remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targetted CPUs.
It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, protocol stacks, though decreasingly for application software,
and is common in computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and
embedded systems.

Tokens of C
 - Identifiers 
    - Variable, function
    - Rules
 - Constant 
    - Numeric constants (Eg: 5,6.2)
    - Character constants (Eg: 'A','b')
    - String constants (Eg: "Enter your Name :")
 - Keywords 
    - 32 Keywords (Eg: if, else, while, for, break, switch, case)
 - Variable 
    - A temporary name given to a memory location in RAM
    - The value can vary
 - Data Types
    - Shows what type of data will be stored into a variable
    - int, char, float, double, long, short
    - Number of bytes allocated to each variable of a specific data type
      - Variables declaration
        - int num;
        - int a,b,c;
      - Variable initialization
        - num = 10;
        - a=b=c=10;
 - Operators
    - Arithemetic Operators (+,-/,*,%)
    - Relational Operators (<,>,=,<=,>=,==,!=)
    - Logical Operators (&&, ||, !)
    - Assignment Operators 
    - Increment or Decrement Operators (++,--)
    - Conditional Operators ( ? : )
    - Bitwise Operators 
 - Conditions Statements
    - Simple if
    - if - else
    - if else ladder
    - Nested if
    - switch-case
